# Payment-Profile-Tokenizer

This is just a proof of concept version of the JS library to tokenize credit cards, similar to eg. Stripe's elements
library https://stripe.com/en-gb-pl/payments/elements

You will need some backend that will receive full credit card data and do the tokenization in your selected gateway
and in the end, return you the token.
